"grid-template-columns" property is setting the width of each column in the grid. The
"repeat(auto-fit, minmax(320px, 1fr))" value means that the columns will be automatically sized to
fit the available space, with a minimum width of 320px and a maximum width of 1fr (which means the
available space will be divided equally among the columns). This allows the grid to adjust to
different screen sizes and device widths. */
