        Friendswood now has about 40,000 residents over 21 
        square miles in two counties – northern Galveston 
        County and southern Harris County. Clear Creek, providing 
        direct water access to the Gulf of Mexico through 
        Clear Lake and Galveston Bay, cuts between the two counties.
        <br>
        <br>
        Friendswood’s attributes make it an attractive place to 
        live, with highly-rated school districts and easy access 
        to jobs, entertainment, cultural sites, and events in 
        Galveston and Houston. There is also easy transportation 
        access by road, rail, or air, with multiple nearby highways and airports.
        <br>
        <br>
        There are few signs of the early Friendswood settlers, but 
        residents, fortunately, preserved or re-created sites that 
        harken back to the community’s founding. In 1971, residents 
        created a replica of the Frank J. Brown home; the first house 
        built in Friendswood in 1895. The home, which includes 
        structural items from the original house, is home to the 
        Frank J. Brown Heritage Museum.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>The museum includes:</b> 
        <ul>
          <li>A first-floor area that represents early Quaker homes.</li>
          <li>Second-floor space for museum displays about Friendswood’s first 50 years, including photos and artifacts.</li>
          <li>A barn built with lumber more than 100 years old.</li>
        </ul>
      
        
        <br>
        <br>
        It’s also possible you might find a fig tree or two in 
        the area, providing a connection to the days when thousands grew here in the early 1900s.
        <br>
        <br>
        But with all that’s changed, some things remain the same. 
        Jocelyn Baker, a longtime resident who was Friendswood’s 
        official historian, had a great love for this town. The 
        former business owner, school teacher and newspaper editor 
        died on June 5, 2022. She was 93 years old.

        <b>About Friendswood</b><br>
        <hr> 
        <p><h2> Founding and Early 1900s</h2></p> 

        The Quakers’ religious movement started in England in the 1600s.
         It soon spread across the world, with some Quakers coming to the 
         United States and founding the Pennsylvania colony. Later, 
         Quakers, also known as Friends, were involved in settling the western territories.
        <br>
        <br>
        ﻿In 1895, two Quakers, Frank Jacob Brown and Thomas Hadley Lewis, 
        decided to start a settlement on 1,538 acres of prairie near four 
        creeks — Clerk, Chigger, Coward’s, and Mary’s. They purchased 
        the land and recorded the name of Friendswood on July 15, 1895, 
        at the Galveston Courthouse.
        <br>
        <br>
        More than a dozen families traveled south and west to settle 
        in the farming community. Most of the new residents, up 
        until 1915, were part of the Quaker colony.
        <br>
        <br>
        In Friendswood’s early years, the settlers’ lives focused 
        on church and school. The devastating, but not fatal, 1900 
        Galveston storm demolished the building that housed the 
        church and school. Lumber from the trees knocked down by 
        the storm was used to build a new two-story building 
        called The Academy. The Academy housed all grade levels 
        until 1914. It was also the church sanctuary until 1949, 
        when it was relocated to the current church building.
        <br>
        <br>
        The land was blessed with fig orchards, satsuma orange 
        orchards, and rice fields. The farming and production of 
        Magnolia figs was a multimillion-dollar business and 
        attracted more residents from the Houston area and beyond 
        during the 1920s. There were almost 18,000 acres of figs 
        in the early 1920s, with two fig preserving plants in Friendswood.
        <br>
        <br>
        During the Depression, families moved to the area to 
        create a new life and began farming. Oil fields discovered 
        in the late 1930s provided jobs for newcomers. Houston 
        businesspeople also started investing in land in Friendswood 
        in the 1940s, especially near the creeks.
        <br>
        <br>
        
        Still, Friendswood remained a small farming community 
        until World War II, with fewer than 500 residents and 
        just a church, school, post office, and grocery store.
